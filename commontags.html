            Education is the current focus of public debate. 
            How we proceed from here is a matter for debate. 
            Over the year we have had several debates about future policy. 
            The team won their Round 3 debate against Mitcham Girls High School. The students were taking part in a debate contest.
             The debate completely changed course after Liz made her speech.
